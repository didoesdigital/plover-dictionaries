# Plover Dictionaries

[Plover](http://stenoknight.com/wiki/FAQ#What_is_Plover.3F) steno dictionaries in JSON format.



## Main Dictionary

Based on [Plover's default `main.json` dictionary](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/blob/master/plover/assets/main.json), this repo contains:

- A main [`dict.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict.json) dictionary, containing many English words using briefs and phonetic strokes, but contains fewer misstrokes.
- A [`google-1000-english.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/google-1000-english.json) dictionary, including 1000 popular English words by N-grams; credit goes to [Josh Kaufman's typing word list from Google's Trillion Word Corpus](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english). This might be a good training dictionary.
- A [`minimal-plover-dict.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/minimal-plover-dict.json) dictionary, using the main `dict.json` minus all the excess strokes and misstrokes for translations that already exist in their shortest form in the `google-1000-english.json` dictionary. This is a good standalone dictionary.
- A [`plover-dict-minus-google-1000-english-words.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/minimal-plover-dict.json) dictionary, using the main `dict.json` minus the `google-1000-english.json` dictionary. Use this together with `google-1000-english.json`.



## Vocabulary Dictionaries

- [`nouns.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/nouns.json) contains a few hundred additional words.
- [`condensed-strokes.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/condensed-strokes.json) contains a combinations of existing strokes in the main Plover dictionary so that they appear in searches when you look up strokes.



## Fingerspelling Dictionaries

Based on [Plover's default `main.json` dictionary](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/blob/master/plover/assets/main.json), this repo contains 2 alternative fingerspelling dictionaries:

- A [`fingerspelling_FPLT.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/fingerspelling_FPLT.json) dictionary, using fingerspelled letters on the left hand and `-FPLT` on the right hand.
- A [`fingerspelling_RBGS.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/fingerspelling_RBGS.json) dictionary, using fingerspelled letters on the left hand and `-RBGS` on the right hand.


## Navigation Dictionary

This dictionary lets you navigate and edit text efficiently on a Mac. You can move the cursor by letter, word, or line, select while doing so, and also backspace or forward delete by character, word, or line. You can also switch tabs, windows, and apps.

To use the following briefs, copy the [`navigation.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/navigation.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config:

As per Plover's default, you use `-R`, `-P`, `-B`, and `-G` for left, up, down, and right.

Use `STPH-` to move by character, `STPH-RB` to jump a word left, and `STPH-BG` to jump a word right.

Use `KPH-` to use Command ⌘, jumping to line beginning and ending, file top and bottom.

Use `STP-` (**s**hi**f**t) to select characters with movement keys. Again, `-RB` and `-BG` work by word.

Use `SHR-` (**s**e**l**ect) to select words with the movement keys. (This and the strokes described above actually add redundant strokes for selecting whole words to the left and right.)

Use `PW*` and `-F`, `-FP`, or `-FPL` for backspacing a character, a word, or a line.

Use `PW*` and `-R`, `-RB`, or `-RBG` for forward deleting a character, a word, or a line.

Use `KPHR-` for Command + Option (⌘⌥) movements (usually for navigating tabs and file trees).

Use `SP-B` to space up/forward and `SP-P` to space down/backward. That is, in the browser use the former stroke to page up and the latter to page down (this is using ⇧Space).

Use `THRAB` for ⌥ ⇓ and `THRAP` for ⌥ ⇑.

Use `TW-` and a direction for tabbing. Adding `-F`/`-L` gives you ⌘⇧[/⌘⇧] to switch tabs forward and backward. Adding `-B`/`-G` gives you ⌘\`/⌘⇧\` to switch windows forward and backward. Adding `-G`/`-R` gives you ⌘Tab/⌘⇧Tab to switch applications forward and backward. Adding `-FB`/`-LG` gives you ⌘[/⌘] to navigate forwards and backwards in a browser. Adding a star to `TW*G` gives you ⌘Tab Tab to switch 2 applications.



## Computer Powerups Dictionary

This dictionary was designed for running commands on a Mac. Copy the [`computer_powerups.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/computer_powerups.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config to use the following briefs:

### Punctuation Powerups Dictionary

- [`punctuation_powerups.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/punctuation_powerups.json) contains additional punctuation briefs such as:
    - pairs of punctuation (`"PWRABGS": "{^}<>{#Left}{^}"`),
    - smart/curly quotation marks (`"TP-L": "{^’}"`), and
    - punctuation that carries capitalisation  (`"KW-GS": "{~|“^}"`).



## Unspaced Punctuation Dictionary

This dictionary uses common briefs for punctuation, but with translations that suppress surrounding spaces (before and after the punctuation) for more precise input. This might be handy for programming, for example.

To use the following briefs, copy the [`unspaced_punctuation.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/unspaced_punctuation.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config:

* `EPB/TKA*RB`: –
* `EPL/TKA*RB`: —
* `KH-FG`: \`
* `KR-RT`: ^
* `KA*RT`: ^
* `T*LD`: ~
* `T*EULD`: ~
* `AEPBGT`: <
* `AEPBG`: <
* `A*EPBGT`: >
* `A*EPBG`: >
* `HR*PB`: <
* `TKPWR*PB`: >
* `PWRABG`: <
* `PWRA*BG`: >
* `KWA*LS`: =
* `KW-L`: =
* `KW-LS`: ==
* `KW*LS`: ===
* `PAO*EUP`: \|
* `R*UPB`: _
* `R*UPBD`: _
* `RUPBD`: _
* `H-PB`: -
* `PH*PBS`: -
* `TK-RB`: --
* `OEU`: /
* `SPWHRAERB`: \
* `P-P`: .
* `HR-PS`: ...
* `A*E`: '
* `AE`: '
* `KW-GS`: "
* `KR-GS`: "
* `PREPB`: (
* `PR*EPB`: )
* `PWR*BGT`: ]
* `PWR-BGT`: [
* `TPR-BGT`: {
* `TPR*BGT`: }
* `TK-PL`: $
* `STA*R`: *
* `SP-PBD`: &
* `HAERB`: #
* `PERS`: %
* `PHR*US`: +

There is an additional stroke for an unspaced double quotation mark combining the opening and closing double quotation mark briefs:

* `KWR-GS`: "

You might then remove the usual strokes for opening and closing double quotation marks from your dictionary so you can still use these marks with spacing on demand. You might also replace these entries with smart or curly double quotation marks, for example:

```
"KW-GS": "{“^}",
"KR-GS": "{^”}",
```

You could then write `Test “test” test.` using `KPA* TEFT KW-GS TEFT KR-GS TEFT TP-PL`.

Similarly with single quotation marks (not included in this dictionary):

```
"TP-P": "{‘^}",
"TP-L": "{^’}",
```



## Symbols Dictionaries

- [`symbols.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols.json) contains common symbols, such as degrees (`"SPWO*L/TKEGS": "°"`) and trademark (`"SPWO*L/TRAEUD/PHARBG": "{^}™"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"TRAEUD/PHARBG": "trademark",` and `"TKEGS": "degrees"`).
- [`symbols_briefs.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols_briefs.json) contains briefs for symbols, such as `"TK*EGS": "°"`.
- [`symbols_currency.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols_currency.json) contains briefs for currency symbols, such as cent (`"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢"`) and dollar (`"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"KREPBT": "cent"` and `"TKHRAR": "dollar"`).
- [`symbols_currency_culled.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols_currency_culled.json) contains only these currency symbols:

```json
"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢",
"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$",
"SPWO*L/*EUR": "€",
"SPWO*L/POUPBD/STERLG": "£",
"SPWO*L/KWREPB": "¥"
```



## Currency Dictionaries

[`currency.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/currency.json) contains briefs for currency words, such as AUD (`"*AUD": "AUD",`) and dollar (`"SWEUS/TPRAEPBG": "Swiss franc",`), a currency formatting stroke (`"K*RPBS": "{*($c)}",` so you can stroke `34/P-P/5/K*RPBS` to write $34.50), as well as briefs:

* `"TKHRAR": "dollar",`
* `"TKHRARS": "dollars",`
* `"PH-LD": "million dollar",`
* `"PH-LDZ": "million dollars",`
* `"PW-LD": "billion dollar",`
* `"PW-LDZ": "billion dollars",`
* `"TR-LD": "trillion dollar",`
* `"TR-LDZ": "trillion dollars",`

You might also like the related symbols currency dictionary:

- [`symbols_currency.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols_currency.json) contains briefs for currency symbols, such as cent (`"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢"`) and dollar (`"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"KREPBT": "cent"` and `"TKHRAR": "dollar"`).


## Australian English Dictionaries

There are two Australian English companion dictionaries, each intended to be used in combination with the default Plover dictionary.

One overrides the default briefs with Australian variations, and also includes Australian prefixes, suffixes, alternative spellings, and vocabulary.  To use this dictionary, copy the [`dict_en_AU.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict_en_AU.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config after the default Plover dictionary so that it overrides default Plover briefs.

The other dictionary uses a kind of suffix stroke, `/A*U`, after every default brief to translate the word to Australian English. For example, to write "empathize", you would stroke `*EPL/THAOEUS`. Then, to write "empathise" you would add `/A*U`. That is, this dictionary's entry for "empathise" is `"*EPL/THAOEUS/A*U": "empathise",`. To use this dictionary, copy the [`dict_en_AU_with_extra_stroke.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict_en_AU_with_extra_stroke.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config after the default Plover dictionary.




### Notes on Design of and Changes in the Australian English Dictionary

These notes concern the main Australian English dictionary, [`dict_en_AU.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict_en_AU.json):

- Briefs primarily form the Australian spelling, while longer phonetic strokes may form the US spelling on demand.
- `A*ER`strokes the "aero" prefix for the Australian spelling of aeroplane
- `*EG` strokes the "eing" suffix for words such as "ageing"
- `*LG` strokes the "ling" suffix for words such as "labelling"
- `*LD` strokes the "led" suffix for words such as "labelled"
- `*EPLT` strokes the "ement" suffix for words such as "judgement", "acknowledgement", "lodgement" and "abridgement"
- `O*UR` strokes the "our" suffix for words such as "humour"
- `KWRO*R` strokes the "iour" suffix for words such as "behaviour"
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `TPHOR` strokes for "nour" endings in words such as "honour"
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `TKOR` strokes for "dour" endings in words such as "candour"
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `KHROR` strokes for "our" endings in words such as "colour"
- For words such as "practice" and "practise", the basic rule is that the noun form uses the "c" spelling while the verb uses the "s" spelling. Therefore, translations have been included for producing both.
  - For example, Australian briefs for "defense" with an "s" will use `S` in the brief itself, while Australian briefs for "defence" with a "c" will drop the `S`, eg, `"TKEFS": "defense"`, `"TKE/TPEPB": "defence"`.
  - As another example, drop the `S` or use `KRE` to spell licence with a "c", eg: `"HR-PB": "licence"`, `"HR-PBS": "license",`
- Use "AE" in strokes for Australian "ae" spellings such as "encyclopaedia":
  - The Australian spelling is used in words stroked with `AE` where it would normally use the long "e" sound stroke `AOE`
  - Briefs form the Australian spelling, eg, "KAOEUPL/RA": "chimaera",
  - Words starting with "ae" can be stroked with the prefix `A` such as `"A/AOE/O*PB": "aeon",`
  - The Australian spelling of "gynaecological" uses briefs and phonetic strokes beginning with `TKPWAOEUPB` => "gyne", while the US spelling uses strokes beginning with `SKWREUPB` => "jyn"



### Australian vocabulary

New briefs have also been added for Australian [diminuitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutives_in_Australian_English), flora, fauna, [slang and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English_vocabulary). For example:

* `"STRA*EU": "Australia",`
* `"STRA*EU/KWRA": "straya",`
* `"PWOE/TKPWAPB": "bogan",`
* `"RE/PHOFL/EUFT": "removalist",`
* `"STRAO*UT": "strewth",`
* `"HROL/HREU": "lolly",`
* `"TKPWAE/TKAEU": "g'day",`
* `"RAO": "roo",`
* `"PHABG/KAS": "Maccas",`



### Changed Briefs

The brief for "programme" is overridden by "pram", requiring a new brief for "program":

    +"PRAPL": "pram",
    +"PRO/TKPWRAPL": "program",

The `*EG` brief for "e.g." is overridden by the "eing" suffix for the Australian spelling of "ageing", requiring a new brief for "e.g.":

    +"AOE/SKWRAO*E": "e.g.",





## Vim Dictionary

Copy the [`vim.json`](https://github.com/dimonster/plover-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/vim.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config to use the following briefs. Note, most strokes use `STPR` to indicate vim (`SR` => `V`):

* `"SREUPL"`: Phonetic brief for "vim".
* `"SR*EUPL"`: Restore brief for "victim" using additional star.
* Punctuation with suppressed spaces to run vim commands (see also: unspaced punctuation dictionary):
    - `"P-P"`: Unspaced period for vim's "last edit" command.
    - `"T*EULD"`: Unspaced tilde for capitalisation. That is, `~`. This brief follows format for tilde `TEULD` with additional star.
    - `"TPHRORB"` => `FLOSH`: Unspaced dollar sign for end of line command.
    - `HR*PB`: Unspaced `<` for left indent.
    - `TKPWR*PB`: Unspaced `>` for right indent.
    - `KW-L`: Unspaced `=`.
    - `OEU`: Unspaced `/` for searching.
* `STPR` and `*`, `-B`, `-G`, `-R` for vim style navigation keys `hjkl`:
    - `"STPR*"`: `h`
    - `"STPR-B"`: `k`
    - `"STPR-G"`: `l`
    - `"STPR-R"`: `j`
    - `"STPR*B"`: `⌃f` to page forward
    - `"STPR*P"`: `⌃b` to page backward
* Move lines up and down in any mode:
    - `.vimrc` mappings are:

            " Move lines up/down using alt j/k when iTerm is set to:
            " Left option (⌥) key acts as Normal
            " In mapping, press opt/alt+j/k to type these characters
            nnoremap ∆ :m .+1<CR>
            nnoremap ˚ :m .-2<CR>

            inoremap ∆ <Esc>:m .+1<CR>gi
            inoremap ˚ <Esc>:m .-2<CR>gi

            vnoremap ∆ :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
            vnoremap ˚ :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv

    - Briefs are:
        - `"PHR-B"` => `MLB`: Move line up using vim style navigation `k`.
        - `"PHR-R"` => `MLR`: Move line down using vim style navigation `j`.
* `"SPWAO*UT"`: Exit insert mode and start substitution. That is, Escape and `:%s/`.
* `"SR*F"`: Exit insert mode and run command to write buffer (i.e. save the file). That is, Escape, `:w`, and Return. Brief format follows brief for Save command `"S*F"`.
* `"STPR*F"`: Exit insert mode and run command to write buffer (i.e. save the file). That is, Escape, `:w`, and Return. This alternative brief format follows brief for Save command `"S*F"` combined with brief format for most of these vim strokes using `STPR`.
* `"STPROEUFRL"`: Steno lookup shortcut that exits insert mode, yanks inside word to system clipboard (this might be Neovim only) using `"yiw` and runs my shortcut for steno lookup tool `⌃⌘⌥⇧s`. Brief format combines vim brief and regular steno lookup brief `STOEUFRL`. To use your own shortcut, replace this part of the translation `{#Control_L(Alt_L(Shift_L(Super_L(s))))}` with your shortcut command.
* `"STPREFBG"`: Exit insert mode and prepare command to write buffer (i.e. save the file) and quit. That is, Escape and `:x`. Brief format follows vim brief format `STPR` and brief for Escape `TPEFBK`.
* `"STPR-FPLT"`: Exit insert mode and write unspaced colon to enter command mode. That is, Escape and `:`.
* `"STPR-L"`: Runs `gt` to go to next tab. Follows brief format of tabs from tab navigation dictionary.
* `"STPR-F"`: Runs `gT` to go to previous tab. Follows brief format of tabs from tab navigation dictionary.

* Single-stroke Control key (`⌃`) fingerspelling modifier collection:
    - `"A*RBL": "{#Control_L(a)}",`
    - `"PW*RBL": "{#Control_L(b)}",`
    - `"KR*RBL": "{#Control_L(c)}",`
